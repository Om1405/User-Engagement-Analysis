# ðŸ“Š User Engagement Analysis â€“ Online Learning Platform

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This project was completed as part of a data analyst intern technical assignment. The objective was to analyze user behavior on an online learning platform using real-world student data, course activity logs, and feedback.

The analysis aimed to identify key engagement trends, satisfaction levels, and improvement opportunities to enhance the learning experience and drive student outcomes.

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used

1. **students.csv** â€“ Student information (Student ID, Name, Age, Gender, Location, Enrolment Date)  
2. **course_activity.csv** â€“ Course activity logs (Student ID, Course ID, Date, Time Spent, Completion %)  
3. **feedback.csv** â€“ Student feedback (Student ID, Course ID, Rating, Feedback Text)

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** â€“ Data cleaning, wrangling, EDA (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization** â€“ Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Power BI** â€“ Interactive dashboards and trend visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Documentation and code execution
- **Markdown** â€“ Reporting and formatting

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed

- Average time spent and completion rates per course
- Engagement differences across age groups and locations
- Correlation between course completion and student satisfaction
- Student segmentation by engagement and feedback
- Visual trends of activity and performance over time

## ðŸ’¡ Top 5 Insights

1. **Higher completion rates** were associated with shorter courses.
2. **25â€“29-year-olds** were the most engaged and satisfied demographic.
3. **Course C102** had the highest time spent but below-average ratings.
4. **Positive correlation** exists between completion and feedback ratings.
5. **Metro cities** showed higher engagement compared to rural areas.

## âœ… Recommendations

- Redesign underperforming courses based on feedback insights.
- Introduce **microlearning modules** to improve completion rates.
- Create targeted campaigns for highly engaged age groups (25â€“29).
